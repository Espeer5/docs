Imagine a world where anyone can build the technology that empowers cutting-edge
medical devices. Where anyone can innovate powerful smart home products of the
future, and where anyone can work on the next generation of autonomous vehicles.
This world, is a wolrd where embedded systems development is accessible to all.

Embedded developers write software that controls the behavior of devices 
ranging from pacemakers to smart thermostats. They interact directly with 
the timing of hardware, requiring very precise control over when instructions
are executed. However, the current entry barriers to the field are
daunting. Today, working on these devices requires costly hardware capable
of running a real-time operating system, known as an RTOS. If you need both an
RTOS and high powered compute, the price tag is extremely steep. The question
is: how can we make this technology accessible to everyone? \\ \hfill \\

Cloud computing has transformed our access to high-performance computing. By
leveraging the cloud, we can build a platform where embedded engineers can
build, test, and deploy applications without the need for expensive hardware.
This platform would offer an environment with native RTOS support, enabling
users to create and test applications with ease over the network.

With streamlined access to RTOS compute time, engineers can focus immediately
on their applications, and the time to get a program off the ground will be 
dramatically reduced. Just as cloud computing accelerated advancements in AI,
this platform will spark rapid innovation in impactful technologies.

This platform isn't just for seasoned developers. It will also open doors for
students and hobbyists, providing access to top-of-the-line tools that were
previously out of reach. This democratization of technology will usher in a
new wave of innovation in the embedded space. As demand for new
applications grows, the market potential for this platform is enormous.

We'll offer this service on a pay-as-you-go basis, so users only pay for what
they use. This model benefits everyone, empowering engineers while generating
significant revenue. \\ \hfill \\

The future of embedded systems development is here, and it's in the cloud.
Our RTOS compute platform will revolutionize how engineers, students, and
hobbyists approach the field, driving the creation of groundbreaking
technologies. With your support, we can turn this vision into reality and
deliver incredible value to developers and the world.
