Imagine a world where developing cutting-edge technology for medical
devices, smart home products, and autonomous vehicles is within reach for
everyone. The potential to create life-saving equipment, enhance everyday
convenience, and revolutionize transportation lies in the hands of embedded
software developers.

Embedded developers write software that controls the behavior of devices 
ranging from pacemakers to smart thermostats. They interact directly with 
the timing of hardware, requiring very precise control over when instructions
are executed. However, the current entry barriers to embedded development are
daunting. Today, developing these devices requires costly hardware capable
of running a real-time operating system, known as an RTOS. If you need both an
RTOS and high powered compute, the price tag is extremely steep. The question
is: how can we make this technology accessible to everyone? \\ \hfill \\

Cloud computing has transformed our access to high-performance computing. By
leveraging the cloud, we can build a platform where developers can develop,
test, and deploy high-precision embedded applications without the need for
expensive hardware. This platform would offer a development environment with
native RTOS support, enabling users to create and test embedded applications
with ease over the network.

With streamlined access to RTOS compute time, developers can focus immediately
on their applications, and the time to get a program off the ground will be 
dramatically reduced. Just as cloud computing accelerated advancements in AI,
this platform will spark rapid innovation in impactful embedded technologies.

This platform isn't just for seasoned developers. It will also open doors for
students and hobbyists, providing access to top-of-the-line tools that were
previously out of reach. This democratization of technology will usher in a
new wave of innovation in the embedded space. As demand for new embedded
applications grows, the market potential for this platform is enormous.

We'll offer this service on a pay-as-you-go basis, so users only pay for what
they use. This model benefits everyone, empowering developers while generating
significant revenue. \\ \hfill \\

The future of embedded systems development is here, and it's in the cloud.
Our cloud RTOS compute platform will revolutionize how developers,
students, and hobbyists approach embedded development, driving the
creation of groundbreaking technologies. With your support, we can turn this
vision into reality and deliver incredible value to developers and the world.
