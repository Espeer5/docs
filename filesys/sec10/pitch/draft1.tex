Imagine a world where developing cutting-edge technology for medical
devices, smart home products, and autonomous vehicles is within reach for
everyone. The potential to create life-saving equipment, enhance everyday
convenience, and revolutionize transportation lies in the hands of embedded
software developers. However, the current barriers to entry are steep, with
high costs and complex hardware requirements.

Today, developing these devices requires costly hardware capable of running
a real-time operating system, known as an RTOS. If you need both and RTOS and
high powered compute, the price tag can be extremely steep. The question is: how
can we make this technology accessible to everyone? \\ \hfill \\

Cloud computing has transformed our access to high-performance computing. By
leveraging the cloud, we can build a platform where developers can develop,
test, and deploy high-precision embedded applications without the need for
expensive hardware. This platform would offer a development environment with
native RTOS support, enabling users to create and test embedded applications
with ease over the network, without the need for expensive equipment.

With easy access to RTOS compute time, developers can focus on their
applications instead of worrying about hardware costs. Just as cloud computing
accelerated advancements in AI, this platform will spark rapid innovation in
impactful embedded technologies.

This platform isn't just for seasoned developers. It will also open doors for
students and hobbyists, providing access to high-precision embedded tools that
were previously out of reach. This democratization of technology will usher in a
new wave of innovation in the embedded systems space. As demand for advanced
embedded systems grows, the market potential for this platform is enormous.

We'll offer this service on a pay-as-you-go basis, so users only pay for what
they use. This model benefits everyone, empowering developers while generating
significant revenue. \\ \hfill \\

The future of embedded systems development is here, and it's in the cloud.
Our cloud RTOS compute platform will revolutionize how developers,
students, and hobbyists approach embedded development, driving the
creation of groundbreaking technologies. With your support, we can turn this
vision into reality and deliver incredible value to developers and the world.
