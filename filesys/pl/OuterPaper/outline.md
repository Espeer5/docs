# Outer Paper Outline

# Introduction
 - Motivation: 
   - Generative AI tools are becoming more and more popular tools for academics
   - However, it how to think about these tools and how to use them is not clear
     - Are they tools? Agents in their own right? Something else?
 - Project:
   - Write a paper using a Gen. AI as a co-author
   - Attempt to use the AI as a full agent in its own right
     - Pull original ideas and arguments from the AI
     - Allow the AI to write sections of the paper and revise the work
 - Result:
    - Gen AI tools are not yet ready to be used as agents in their own right in academic writing
      - Cannot provide details or context for their ideas
      - Produce false or misleading information
      - Align too readily with the user's biases
    - However, they can be used as tools to generate ideas and arguments

# Background
 - Generative AI tools are becoming more and more popular
 - GPT-3, BERT, etc.
 - These tools are often used as tools to generate ideas and arguments
 - Describe the paper I wrote using llama as a co-author
   - Subject matter, idea, arguments, etc.
   - Describe the full role of the AI in the writing process and provide exampels from the logs
   - Present timeline of the writing process and how the AI was used in each phase

# Analysis
 - Describe the strengths of the AI as a tool
   - Can generate ideas and arguments
   - Can provide a starting point for further research
   - Can help to structure and organize a paper
 - Describe the limitations of the AI as an agent in its own right
   - Cannot provide details or context for their ideas
   - Produce false or misleading information
   - Align too readily with the user's biases
   - (Defend why these limitations reduce the status of the AI to a tool)

# Conclusion
 - Generative AI tools are not yet ready to be used as agents in their own right in academic writing
 - However, they can be used as tools to generate ideas and arguments
 - They should therefore not be seen as co-authors, or the owners of the ideas they generate, but as tools to be used by the author such as a pen or a computer
