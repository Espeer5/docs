\section{Introduction}
In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) published a paper,~\cite{EPR_1935},
which set up the first half of a conundrum in quantum mechanics. EPR argued
through a thought experiment that assuming locality in quantum mechanics meant 
that the $\psi$-function could not provide a complete description of a physical
system — that there must be hidden variables that pre-determine the outcomes of
measurements. Thirty years later, in 1964, John Bell published a
paper,~\cite{Bell_1964}, that showed there could be no such hidden variables. 
Together, these two papers can be thought of as setting up the following
argument: if the predictions of quantum mechanics are correct, then quantum 
mechanics is an inherently non-local theory. 

What is troubling about non-locality? Einstein was famously opposed to it,
naming the implied non-locality of quantum mechanics ``spooky action at a
distance.'' This ``action at a distance'' is the idea that two particles can be
space-like separated, and yet still be correlated in a way that is not
deterministic. This notion directly conflicts with a natural understanding of
causality, inspiring the resistance against it. Yet perhaps not all is lost. 
A general attitude towards this non-locality is shown by this quote
from~\cite{Griffiths_2020}: ``Causal influences cannot propagate faster than
light, but there is no compelling reason why ethereal ones should not. The 
influences associated with the collapse of the wave function are of the latter
type, and the fact that they 'travel' faster than light may be surprising, but
it is not, after all, catastrophic.''

In this essay, I will explore the concept of ``ethereal non-locality'' and its
implications for causal influence in quantum mechanics. I will challenge 
Griffiths' claim that ethereal influences are not catastrophic (catastrophic to
whose or what's ends?) and argue that the non-locality of quantum mechanics does 
indeed pose a major challenge to our philosophy of causality.

I will first present the EPR argument and Bell's theorem, and demonstrate the 
relevant technical details of quantum theory. I will then discuss dominant
theories of causation and causal inference, and show how they are challenged by
the non-locality of quantum mechanics. Finally, I will argue that rather than 
accepting ethereal non-locality as a benign feature of quantum mechanics and 
arguing that it is not catastrophic, we should instead take it as a serious
challenge to be addressed by future research in the philosophy of physics, with 
consequences not only for our understanding of quantum mechanics, but also for
our understanding and broader application of causal inference.

\section{The EPR-Bell Argument}

The EPR and Bell arguments both deal with the concept of entanglement. Entangled
particles are those which have been prepared such that they are described by a
wave function that is not separable into the wave functions of the individual
particles, resulting in a correlation between the two particles. For simplicity,
we will sum up both EPR and Bell using the same example of an entangled system,
the GHZ state given in~\cite{GHZ_2007}. The GHZ is a three-particle entangled
state, with the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If spin is measured along the $x$-axis for all three particles, the 
          number of particles with spin up will always be odd.
    \item If spin is measured along the $x$ axis for the one particle, and along
          the $z$-axis for the third particle, the number of particles with spin
          up will always be even.
\end{itemize}

On this experimental setup, the EPR argument would ask us to consider the
following: In the case of either measurement, all $x$ spin or one $x$ and two
$z$ spins, if we measure the first two outcomes, we can predict the third outcome
with certainty. \textit{Before I ever measure} teh third particle, I know what 
the outcome of the measurement will be. However, I could not predict this
outcome from the preparation of the state alone. This means that one of two
things happened: either the state of the third particle was determined at the
time of preparation, or the measurement of the first two particles somehow
influenced the outcome of the third particle instantaneously. EPR assume
locality to hold, and so they conclude that the state of the third particle must
determined prior to measurement. However, the key takeaway is that if quantum
mechanics is local, then the $\psi$-function cannot provide a complete
description of the physical system — there must be some hidden variable which 
determined the outcome prior to the measurement which was not captured in the 
$\psi$-function.

Bell's work, on the other hand, shows that there can be no such hidden variable.
If the outcomes of the measurement are determined by some hidden variable prior
to measurement, then there must be some way to assign outcomes of measurements 
to each of the particles in the state before measurement. Bell showed that this
cannot be done — There is no way to assign the states of the particles in the 
GHZ state so that the parities of the outcomes of the measurements are
consistent with the predictions of quantum mechanics.

EPR and Bell put together show the following: If the relevant predictions of 
quantum mechanics are correct, then the theory is non-local. The wealth of 
experimental evidence put together since the 1960s has shown that the predictions
of quantum mechanics are indeed correct, and therefore, quantum mechanics is a
non-local theory.

\section{Non-local Causation?}

As previously mentioned, Griffiths acknowledges the locality given by EPR-Bell, 
but refers to this non-locality as ``ethereal'' and not causal. This begs the
question of what we mean by causality, and when we can conclude that an
interaction is or isn't causal. Until we have a clear account of causality, we 
cannot say whether or not the correlation between the measurements in the GHZ
state is causal.

There are a number of philosophical theories of causation, but the two most
relevant to this discussion are the counterfactual theory of causation and the
process theory of causation. The counterfactual theory of causation, as
formulated by~\cite{Lewis_1973}, states that $A$ causes $B$ if and only if $B$
would not have occurred if $A$ had not occurred. The process theory of
causation, on the other hand, states that $A$ causes $B$ if and only if there is
a causal process that connects $A$ to $B$.

If one adopts a process theory of causation, then it seems that we may safely 
conclude that the correlation between the measurements in the GHZ state is not
causal. One simply concludes that ``processes'' may not travel faster than the
speed of light (this can be considered an outcome of the theory of relativity)
and so the correlation between the measurements in the GHZ state cannot be
causal.

However, the dominant theory of causation which underlies the process of causal 
discovery and inference is the counterfactual theory. The statistical method of
causal discovery, as formulated by~\cite{Pearl_1995} relies on this theory, 
formulating a counterfactual as a conditional probability. The counterfactual
probability if $B$ given $A$ is the probability that $B$ would have occurred if
$A$ had occurred, while holding fixed all those variables which do not lie along
a causal pathway from $A$ to $B$. This method has been used to great success in
a number of fields, including epidemiology, economics, and computer science.

Let us consider the GHZ state in the context of this method of causal inference.
If we consider the counterfactual probability of the outcome of the third
particle given the outcomes of the first two particles, we find that the outcome
of the third particle is perfectly correlated with the outcomes of the first two
particles. By preparing the GHZ state specifically we have conditioned on the 
preparation of the state, and so, as in the EPR argument, we reach the following
conlusion. Either there are some other variables to be considered in our causal
model, or the correlation between the measurements in the GHZ state is causal
according to our causal inference. Given Bell's work, there may be no hidden 
variable to consider, and so we must conclude that according to our common 
understanding of causality, this influence is causal.

We are now left with two options. Either we accept this relationship as causal,
and thus must acccept causal influence that travels faster than the speed of
light, or our dominant approach to causality is flawed and requires revision.
As Griffiths points out, the former is catastrophic — however, I contend, so is
the latter. If a dominant theory and approach to causation is marked flawed by
fundamental physics, then we must interrogate our use of causal inference and 
understanding if and why it still works.

\section{Discussion}

Due to the physical consequences of accepting non-local causality, we should
prefer to accept that quantum mechanics provides a fundamental challenge to the 
counterfactual approach to causal inference and the theory that underlies it.
If this is the case, we should examine what precise aspects of causal inference
fail, and what we can do to revise them.

One key assumption underlying causal inference is the assumption of the
faithfulness condition. This assumption holds that any two variables in a causal
model which are dependent are either causally related or have a common cause.
This is the assumption that clearly fails in the GHZ state — the outcomes of the
measurements are fully dependent, but there is no common cause, and we want to
assume that there is no causal relationship between the measurements.

This violation of faithfulness is concerning. Despite the fact that faithfulness
holds in the majority of cases, the fact that it fails for fundamental physics
shows that the universe may be inherently non-faithful. If this is the case,
then it is not clear how we can justify our assumption of faithfulness when we 
perform causal analysis. It is probable that we can still assume faithfulness 
on certain types of variables and certain circumstances, but we may then need
an account of when we can and cannot assume faithfulness, and how our
fundamental physics can predict the faithfulness of a system.

In conclusion, the non-locality of quantum mechanics shown through the 
EPR and Bell arguments poses a fundamental challenge to the assumptions
underlying our dominant theories of causation and causal inference. While we
have theories of causation such as process theory which can handle the exclusion
of non-local causation, the counterfactual approach which underlies
techniques of causal inference and discovery is fundamentally challenged by the
non-locality of quantum mechanics. While Griffiths may consider this challenge 
to be ``non-catastrophic'', I argue that it poses a fundamental challenge to our
understanding of causality and requires further research in the philosophy of
physics and causal inference.
